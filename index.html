		<p>
			In todays world the internet is commonplace, it is everywhere from up high in space down to nanobots. Almost
			anyone in the world
			can communicate with anyone just with the click of a button. Up until this point the internet has been
			relatively unsecure, as
			there was nothing "important" stored on the internet, however, this is the start of the digital age, an age
			in need of secure
			technologies and platforms to protect people from cyber-attacks and surveillence.

		<div style="background-color: rgb(146, 146, 146);
		border: solid 5px rgb(146, 68, 68);
		border-radius: 5px;
		padding: 10px;color:black;">Are there genuine concerns? Why or why not? Are they exaggerated?</div>
		<p>
			Privacy and security concerns are growing each day with 0-day exploits (new unknown exploits) being found
			and used for malicious purposes and a new age of computer hackers, but even with all this the amount of
			cybersecurity awareness is still very low with the most common password in 2020 being 123456 (2020, Shibu.
			Sherin).
			There are some people promoting cyber-awareness and online privacy such as Rob Braxman Tech. In this age we
			need more people
			like this to help educate everyone on why cybersecurity and privacy is important.
		</p>
		<p>
			A main concern for privacy is China's surveillence state. China is renowned around the world for having
			constant surveillence over all their citizens
			and keeping a social score on everyone. This social credit score an also be used to prohibit citizens from
			leaving the country. An example of some things
			that can decreace social credit score are: Eating on Bejing's rapid-transport system, Cheating in online
			video games, Jaywalking and if a pedestrian or moped driver commits 5 or more
			traffic violations (Jaywalking, Red-light running) their personal information may be displayed publicly on
			billboards at traffic lights.<br><br> According to a help bot
			on the Chinese social credit system website (2021), "The social credit system refers to the general term for
			a series of arrangements to promote the credit commitments
			of all parties in society, including institutional arrangements, credit information recording, collection
			and disclosure mechanisms, institutions and market
			arrangements for collecting and publishing credit information, regulatory systems, and publicity. The
			ultimate goal of various aspects such as educational
			arrangements or various small systems is to form a good social credit environment.".<br><br>
			<img width="100%" src="./img/china_moment.jpg"><br>
			<br> The main goals of the Social Credit system are: "The main goals
			of the social credit system are: by 2020, the basic laws, regulations and standard systems for social credit
			will be basically established, the credit
			information system covering the whole society based on the sharing of credit information resources will be
			basically completed, the credit supervision system
			will be basically sound, and the credit management system will be basically complete. The service market
			system is relatively complete, and trustworthy
			incentives and untrustworthy punishment mechanisms are fully functioning. Significant progress has been made
			in the construction of government integrity,
			business integrity, social integrity, and judicial credibility, and market and social satisfaction has
			increased significantly. The whole society's awareness of
			integrity has generally increased, the credit environment for economic and social development has improved
			significantly, and the economic and social order has
			improved significantly."
